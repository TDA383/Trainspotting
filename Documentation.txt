This document justifies that our solution to the train program is valid by
discussing our code, the placement of the sensors and by giving some simulation
examples.

We have concluded that a critical section is where two trains are forced to
share one track. Therefore there are three critical sections: the cross-section
by the station at the top (station 1), and the two tracks between switches 1
and	2 respectively 3 and 4. Switches 1 and 2 are the switches closest to
station 1, and switches 3 and 4 are those closest to station 2.

Each critical section requires 4 sensors, since there are four ways to enter
every critical section. We have decided that the two track section in the middle
is not a critical section, since the trains can always pass simultaneously.
The exact placement of each sensor was decided through testing, to make sure that
there is enough braking distance for our maximum speed.

We have set the maximum speed to 20 since that gives us a good spread of sensors, 
while maintaining a good train flow.

We tested our solution using different train speeds and different simulation speeds until
we found the best speed and the best way to place the sensors. We also used debug messages 
in the train program to help us find bugs.
